                            JavaScript is a simple programming language that runs in any browser JavaScript Engine. Whereas Node JS is an interpreter or running environment for a JavaScript programming language that holds many excesses, it requires libraries that can easily be accessed from JavaScript programming for better use.
                            JavaScript is normally used for any client-side activity for one web application. An activity can be addressing business validation or dynamic page display in some schedule time interval or basic Ajax call kind of task. Those are used for a maximum time for any web application. Whereas Node JS mainly used for accessing or running any operating system for non-blocking operation. An operation like creating or executing a shell script, or getting some specific hardware-related information on one call or installed certificate details in the system or a lot of define task is non-blocking on an operating system.
                            JavaScript running in any engine like Spider monkey (FireFox), JavaScript Core (Safari), V8 (Google Chrome). So JavaScript programming is very easy to write, and put any running environment means proper browser. Whereas Node JS only support the V8 engine, which googles chrome specific. But whether it supports the V8 engine, written JavaScript code can able to run in any environment. So there has no browser-specific constraint on it.

                            So, if we want to write some kind of stand-alone program or server in Javascript, then we can use nodejs for it. And If we want our application needs the ability to persistently store data in a way that we can efficiently query or update it later, then we would typically use some form of database

                            JWT or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued
